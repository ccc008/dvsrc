This is collection of code samples on different programming languages (C++, Delphi, C#, Java for Android, XSLT and etc). The samples were written as parts of messages in <a href='http://derevyanko.blogspot.com/'>my blog</a>. The blog is in Russian, so it's a problem for non-Russian people to read it. To solve the problem, I am going to public all source codes here and write short wiki-description for them in English. Hope, this job will be useful for someone :)
